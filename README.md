# Mangosta for iOS

Mangosta for iOS is an open source, open standard, XMPP/Jabber client.

It is designed to be a technology demonstration: it is not available on the AppStore. You can install it as you wish.

Mangosta for iOS is part of the [MongooseIM platform](https://github.com/esl/MongooseIM).

It comes with features such as:
* Group chats (MUC Light)
* One-to-one chats
* Microblogging
* Block/unblock users
* Contacts management (Roster)
* Token-based reconnection
* Instant stream resumption

The project has 2 different implementations/targets (same features in both):
* Mangosta: only XMPP
* Mangosta REST: XMPP + some features powered with the MongooseIM REST API

Feel free to comment, we will be glad to hear from your uses.
